Face Recognition: 1) Taken the face images.
				  2) Using the concepts of SVD, performed the face recognition.This can be done by taking some samples of all different faces and forming the basis.
				  3) Then I have taken a new face image (one that you have not used earlier) and determine which personâ€™s face is in the test image.

				  This can be done using MATLAB.
